# Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Fatuma, and I am an engineering and robotics student with a strong interest in UX design and data analysis. 
I enjoy learning about emerging technologies and exploring how they can improve accessibility and communication, especially through sign language interpretation.

I’m passionate about creating solutions that merge technology and inclusivity, and I’m excited to learn how to use GitHub effectively for my future projects.
